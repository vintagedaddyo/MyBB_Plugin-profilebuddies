Profile Buddies plugin adds a list of all buddies to profile. You can set the maximum buddies to show in Admin CP. It allows you to directly add or remove a member to your own buddy list from profile!

As an extra your members will get an email or pm notification when someone adds them to buddy list (it's an option in Admin CP).
